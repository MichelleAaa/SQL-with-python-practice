Before editing models.py, we created a database named twitter (in the week3 folder -- in the terminal):

docker exec -i pg_container psql -c 'CREATE DATABASE twitter;'

Updates are made to the models.py file.
Afterwards, flask db migrate is ran to generate the new migrations file  in twitter/migrations/versions. 

After the file is generated, we run -- flask db upgrade -- for the upgrade function to run in the new migration file. (In the terminal it will show the creation of tables and the like.)
